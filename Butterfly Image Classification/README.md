# Butterfly Image Classification - Project Overview and Approach  

---

## üêõ Project Description  
This project involves building a deep learning model to classify images of butterflies into 75 distinct species using the Butterfly Image Classification dataset from Kaggle.  
The aim is to develop an image classification pipeline leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with data augmentation to improve model generalization and accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Approach to the Dataset  

### 1. Data Exploration  
- Loaded the training and testing CSV files containing image filenames and class labels (for training data).  
- Explored dataset dimensions: 6499 labeled training images and 2786 unlabeled test images.  
- Identified 75 unique butterfly species for classification, with a relatively balanced label distribution verified via count plots.  
- Sampled and visualized images from multiple classes to understand visual diversity and complexity.

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- Utilized `ImageDataGenerator` for real-time image scaling and extensive augmentation including:
  - Rotation (up to 30 degrees),  
  - Width and height shifts (10%),  
  - Zooming (up to 20%),  
  - Horizontal flipping.  
- Created train and validation data generators with an 80-20 split and class mode set to categorical for multi-class classification.

### 3. Model Architecture  
- Designed a sequential CNN with three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction.  
- Used ReLU activation for non-linearity and softmax output for class probabilities.  
- Included dense layers with 512 and 256 units before the final output layer, enabling learning of complex feature representations.

### 4. Training Strategy  
- Compiled model with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss suited for multi-class classification.  
- Trained the model for 20 epochs using GPU acceleration, monitoring validation accuracy for potential overfitting.  
- Achieved a training accuracy exceeding 85% and validation accuracy around 68%, indicating room for improvement.

### 5. Testing and Prediction  
- Prepared a separate test generator without augmentation but with rescaling for pixel normalization.  
- Predicted classes for test images by passing batches through the trained model.  
- Randomly selected test images to visualize true images alongside predicted species labels for qualitative assessment.

## üìà Observations  
- The data augmentation enhanced the model's ability to generalize, though validation accuracy suggests further tuning is needed.  
- The large number of classes and subtle visual differences between species present challenges.  
- Model complexity is high with 44 million parameters, leading to increased training time and potential overfitting risks.  
- Future improvements could include transfer learning from powerful pretrained models, dropout layers, and hyperparameter tuning.

## üîÆ Future Directions  
- Incorporate pretrained CNN architectures such as VGG16, ResNet, or EfficientNet for improved feature extraction.  
- Add regularization techniques like Dropout and Batch Normalization.  
- Perform cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to boost model accuracy and robustness.  
- Explore ensembling techniques and data balancing for rare class handling.
