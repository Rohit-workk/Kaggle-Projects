# Student Success Factors and Insights - Project Overview and Approach

---

## üìÇ Dataset  
Dataset source: [Student Success Factors and Insights - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anassarfraz13/student-success-factors-and-insights)  
- Samples: 6,607 students  
- Features: 20 (academic, socio-economic, behavioral, and demographic factors)  
- Target variable: `ExamScore` (final exam score, continuous variable)

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering  
This rich dataset encapsulates diverse factors influencing student performance‚Äîfrom study habits and attendance to socio-economic background and parental involvement.  

- Categorical and numerical features were encoded carefully to reflect domain expertise.  
- Minimal missing data was handled by targeted data cleaning to maintain dataset integrity.  
- Correlation heatmaps illuminated strong positive relationships with exam success, notably HoursStudied, PreviousScores, TutoringSessions, and Attendance.

## üß† Modeling & Performance  
- Regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost were applied.  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor emerged as the best performer with an R2 score around 0.70, emphasizing the non-linear nature of academic success predictors.  
- Ensemble models particularly excelled in capturing complex feature interactions beyond linear models‚Äô reach.
