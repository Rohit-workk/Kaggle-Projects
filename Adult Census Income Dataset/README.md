# Adult Census Income Dataset - Project Overview and Data Analysis

---

## 📂 Dataset
Dataset source: [Adult Census Income Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emanfatima2025/adult-census-income-dataset)  
- Samples: 32,561  
- Features: 15 (mixture of numerical and categorical)  
- Target variable: `income` (binary classification: >50K or <=50K annual income)

---

## 🔍 Data Overview
- Dataset includes demographic, educational, employment, and financial features such as age, workclass, education, occupation, relationship, race, gender, and capital gains/losses.  
- There are missing values represented as "?" specifically in `workclass`, `occupation`, and `native.country`. These were replaced with `NaN` for proper handling.  
- Class imbalance is observed with a majority belonging to the <=50K income group.

---

## ⚙️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Replaced missing value placeholders ("?") with `NaN`.  
- Filled missing values appropriately or flagged them during data processing.  
- Analyzed data types and value distributions across features.  
- Explored unique value counts to distinguish categorical from continuous variables.  

---

## 📊 Data Exploration & Visualization
- Count plots and pie charts were used to visualize categorical feature distributions.  
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and histograms plotted feature distributions with respect to groupings such as income level, race, and sex.  
- This helped in identifying trends, potential outliers, and distributional biases in the dataset.

---

## 🧬 Feature Engineering & Insights
- Converted categorical variables to appropriate encodings for modeling.  
- Treated missing data to avoid model biases.  
- Correlation analysis helped identify relationships among numerical features and between features and target groups.  
- Visualized interactions such as income by education level, occupation, and marital status.

## 🔮 Next Steps in Modeling  
- Prepare data splits and scaling if needed.  
- Encode categorical variables suitably (e.g., one-hot, label encoding).  
- Use feature selection techniques to identify most predictive features.  
- Train classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.  
- Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to address class imbalance.

## 📌 Usage Notes  
- This analysis is designed to run in Python with typical libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.  
- Kaggle notebooks provide a ready environment to reproduce and experiment with the dataset and analysis pipeline.
