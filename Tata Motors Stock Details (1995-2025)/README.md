## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data covers daily stock details spanning 1995 to 2025 for Tata Motors on NSE.  
- Checked for missing values; notable missingness found in `Trades` column from 1995-2011, and minor missing values in moving averages for early years.  
- Date column converted to datetime; dataset ordered chronologically for time series analysis.  
- Visualized distributions of key numerical variables (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Turnover, VWAP) via histograms and boxplots revealing skewness and outliers typical of financial time series.  
- Time series plots display price and volume trends with seasonal and long-term patterns evident.  
- Correlation heatmap identifies strong interdependencies among OHLC variables, volume, and technical indicators.

## üß† Modeling Approach  
- Handled missing data by dropping rows missing critical features like Trades, MA_20, and MA_50.  
- Standard scaled numerical features to ensure uniform scale for learning algorithms.  
- Split dataset into training and test sets preserving temporal order for realistic evaluation.  
- Applied regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost.  
- Best model: Gradient Boosting Regressor with an R2 score of ~0.975, accurately capturing complex stock price movements.  
- Random Forest and Linear-based models also achieved strong performance, while AdaBoost and DecisionTree lagged slightly.

## üìä Key Insights and Observations  
- Market prices show expected volatility, with outliers reflecting real market shocks or extreme trading days.  
- Technical indicators such as moving averages play a significant role in predicting stock movement.  
- Ensemble regressors vastly outperform linear ones, underscoring the non-linear dynamics of financial data.  
- Missing data concentrated in early years highlights evolving data quality at exchanges historically.  
- Longitudinal data enables modeling of cyclical and momentum effects in stock price behavior.

## üîÆ Future Directions  
- Experiment with LSTM and other deep learning models tailored for sequential time series.  
- Incorporate additional macroeconomic indicators or sentiment data for enriched forecasting.  
- Deploy advanced feature engineering with technical indicator combinations and lag features.  
- Test models on recent market shocks for robust out-of-sample forecasting.
