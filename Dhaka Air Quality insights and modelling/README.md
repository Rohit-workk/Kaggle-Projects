### AQI Categories  
- Categorized hourly AQI into standard categories: Good, Moderate, Unhealthy for Sensitive, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy, Hazardous.  
- Yearly and monthly analysis of AQI categories shows increasing pollutant levels over time with variability across months and times of day.

### Outlier Analysis  
- Outliers detected in AQI and some pollutant measures likely reflect real pollution events, not measurement errors.  
- No data censoring applied to preserve genuine environmental spikes.

---

## üìä Temporal Trends and Visualization
- Yearly averages, max, and min for pollutants show increasing trends in AQI and particulate matter from 2000 to 2025.  
- Monthly and hourly trends highlight seasonal and diurnal variations, with pollutant peaks in specific months and times of day consistent with weather and human activities.  
- Heatmaps and correlation matrix reveal strong correlations between AQI and particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), moderate correlations with NO2 and CO.

## üß† Modeling Approach and Performance

### Regression Models evaluated to predict AQI:

| Model                  | R2 Score  | Notes                                  |
|------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression      | 0.9323    | Good fit, but linear limitations       |
| Ridge Regression       | 0.9323    | Similar to Linear, regularization helps|
| Lasso Regression       | 0.9322    | Slightly lower, feature selection effect|
| ElasticNet             | 0.9322    | Combination of L1 and L2 effects       |
| Random Forest Regressor| 0.9999999 | Extremely accurate capturing non-linear relationships |
| Gradient Boosting      | 0.999907  | High accuracy with non-linear modeling|
| AdaBoost Regressor     | 0.99397   | High accuracy, less prone to overfit   |
| Decision Tree          | 0.9999999 | Very high but may overfit               |

- Tree-based ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) outperform linear models significantly in capturing complex air pollution patterns.  
- High R2 values near 1 indicate excellent fit, but careful validation needed to prevent overfitting.

## üîÆ Future Work Recommendations  
- Perform time-series modeling using ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM to forecast AQI based on temporal patterns.  
- Optimize tree-based models with hyperparameter tuning to improve generalization.  
- Investigate seasonal and event-driven pollution spikes for intervention planning.  
- Develop a real-time AQI prediction and alert system for Dhaka city.

---

## üìå Usage  
- The analysis is implemented in Python using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.  
- Kaggle Notebook environment is recommended for reproducibility.
